# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The repo centres on containerizing the Vortex RISC-V toolchain. `Dockerfile` builds the Ubuntu 22.04 image, installs dependencies, compiles the toolchain into `/opt/riscv`, and writes helper env scripts. `docker-compose.yml` names the service `vortex`, mounts `./data` to `/data`, and injects user IDs via args. Host helpers (`host-bootstrap.sh`, `build-docker.sh`, `run-docker.sh`, `rsync_csi_to_M.sh`) live at the root; add new automation beside them with actionable file names. Keep persistent build outputs under `data/`, and avoid committing heavy binaries or secrets.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use `./host-bootstrap.sh` once per machine to install Docker plus the compose plugin (runs with sudo if needed). `./build-docker.sh` refreshes `.env`, prunes stale build cache, and executes `docker compose build`. `./run-docker.sh` ensures the container is up and opens an interactive shell; it requires `.env` to define `CONTAINER_NAME`. Helpful diagnostics include `docker compose logs vortex -f` for streaming output and `docker exec -ti $CONTAINER_NAME bash` for extra sessions.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Scripts should target Bash, start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, and enable strict mode (`set -euo pipefail`). Match the existing two-space indentation in YAML and shell blocks, keep 120-character lines, and reserve ALL_CAPS for exported variables (`USER_ID`, `TOOLDIR`). Descriptive lowercase names suit locals (`script_dir`). Run `shellcheck` or `bash -n` before submitting.

## Testing Guidelines
We rely on smoke tests rather than formal suites. After changing the Dockerfile or orchestration scripts, rebuild and launch the stack (`./build-docker.sh && ./run-docker.sh`) and confirm tool binaries appear on the `PATH` inside the container. Capture any regressions with `docker compose logs vortex` and note manual checks in your PR description. Propose CI additions when you introduce repeatable validation steps.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
History is still forming, so adopt Conventional Commits in the imperative mood (e.g., `chore(container): sync env defaults`). Keep each commit focused on one concern. Pull requests must summarize the change, list verification commands, mention follow-up tasks, and link issues when relevant. Attach screenshots only when they add clarity (UI, dashboards).

## Environment & Security Notes
`.env` stays untracked; it stores host-specific IDs and the container name. Never bake credentials or keys into the Docker imageâ€”pass them as secrets, bind mounts, or environment overrides at runtime. When updating toolchain sources, prefer pinned tags or checksums and document any new network requirements.
